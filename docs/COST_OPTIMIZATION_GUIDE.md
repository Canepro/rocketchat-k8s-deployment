## 🛠️ Cost Monitoring Setup

### Azure Cost Management Configuration

#### 1. Cost Alerts Setup
```bash
# Azure CLI commands for cost monitoring
az monitor action-group create \
  --name "cost-alerts" \
  --resource-group "rocketchat-rg" \
  --short-name "cost" \
  --email-receiver "admin@yourdomain.com"
```

#### 2. Budget Alerts
```bash
# Create monthly budget with alerts
az consumption budget create \
  --budget-name "monthly-budget" \
  --resource-group "rocketchat-rg" \
  --amount 80 \
  --time-grain "Monthly" \
  --start-date "2025-09-01" \
  --end-date "2025-12-01" \
  --notifications "cost-alerts"
```

### Azure Portal Cost Monitoring

#### Daily Monitoring Tasks
1. **Access Azure Cost Management**:
   - Portal → Cost Management + Billing → Cost analysis
   - Filter by subscription and resource group

2. **Key Metrics to Monitor**:
   - Daily spend vs budget
   - Service breakdown (AKS, Storage, Networking)
   - Resource utilization vs cost

3. **Cost Analysis Views**:
   - **Accumulated costs**: Track spending over time
   - **Cost by service**: Identify highest cost areas
   - **Cost by resource**: Pinpoint expensive resources

## 🔧 Resource Optimization Implementation

### Phase 1: Immediate Resource Rightsizing

#### Update Rocket.Chat Resources
```yaml
# aks/config/helm-values/values-official.yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m      # Reduced from 1000m (-50%)
    memory: 1536Mi # Reduced from 2048Mi (-25%)
  requests:
    cpu: 250m      # Reduced from 500m (-50%)
    memory: 512Mi  # Reduced from 1024Mi (-50%)
```

#### Update MongoDB Resources
```yaml
# aks/config/mongodb-standalone.yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 300m      # Reduced from 1000m (-70%)
    memory: 512Mi  # Reduced from 2048Mi (-75%)
  requests:
    cpu: 100m      # Reduced from 500m (-80%)
    memory: 256Mi  # Reduced from 1024Mi (-75%)
```

### Phase 2: Storage Optimization

#### Storage Class Analysis
```bash
# Check current storage classes
kubectl get storageclass

# Analyze PVC usage
kubectl get pvc -n rocketchat -o json | jq '.items[] | {name: .metadata.name, storage: .spec.resources.requests.storage, used: .status.capacity.storage}'
```

#### Storage Rightsizing Recommendations
```
Current: 30Gi MongoDB + 30Gi Rocket.Chat = 60Gi total
Optimized: 15Gi MongoDB + 15Gi Rocket.Chat = 30Gi total (-50%)
Potential Savings: £5-8/month on storage costs
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Cost Optimizations

#### Reserved Instances (Future Consideration)
```bash
# Check RI recommendations
az consumption reservation recommendation list \
  --subscription-id "your-subscription-id" \
  --look-back-period "7" \
  --scope "Shared"
```

#### Spot Instances for Non-Critical Workloads
- Consider spot instances for development/testing
- Implement pod disruption budgets for production stability
