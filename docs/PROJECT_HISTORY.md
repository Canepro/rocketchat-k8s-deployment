✅ **Official Deployment**: Rocket.Chat and monitoring stack successfully deployed
✅ **SSL Certificates**: Rocket.Chat certificate issued and working
✅ **Clean URLs**: Grafana configured without /grafana path
✅ **Microservices Architecture**: Full Rocket.Chat microservices running

### **3.4 SSL Certificate Resolution (September 5, 2025)**

**Issue Identified:**
- Grafana SSL certificate stuck in "ISSUING" status for 16+ hours
- cert-manager logs showed "propagation check failed" errors
- Certificate requests were failing due to incorrect ingress class configuration

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- ClusterIssuer configured with `ingress.class: public` but AKS uses `nginx` ingress class
- ACME HTTP-01 solver ingresses were using wrong ingress controller
- Certificate validation requests were routed to Grafana service instead of ACME solver pod

**Resolution Steps:**
1. **Updated ClusterIssuer**: Changed `ingress.class` from `public` to `nginx` in `clusterissuer.yaml`
2. **Applied Configuration**: `kubectl apply -f clusterissuer.yaml`
3. **Recreated Certificate**: Deleted failing certificate and recreated with corrected configuration
4. **Verified Success**: Certificate issued successfully within minutes

**Technical Details:**
```yaml
# Before (Incorrect)
solvers:
- http01:
    ingress:
      class: public  # ❌ Wrong ingress class

# After (Correct)
solvers:
- http01:
    ingress:
      class: nginx   # ✅ Correct ingress class
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Grafana SSL certificate now READY and functional
- ✅ Both Rocket.Chat and Grafana accessible via HTTPS
- ✅ Certificate auto-renewal working correctly
- ✅ No service disruption during fix

**Prevention Measures:**
- Added ingress class validation to deployment checklists
- Updated troubleshooting documentation with SSL certificate diagnostics
- Enhanced monitoring for certificate issuance status

### **3.5 Ingress Disruption During Helm Upgrade (September 5, 2025)**

**Issue Identified:**
- Grafana became inaccessible with 404 errors after Helm upgrade
- Ingress resource missing from monitoring namespace
- Services running but unreachable via configured domain

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Helm upgrade removed manually created ingress without replacement
- Service naming mismatch: backup pointed to `grafana-service`, actual service is `monitoring-grafana`
- kube-prometheus-stack chart uses different service naming conventions
- No ingress backup verification before upgrade

**Resolution Steps:**
1. **Identified Missing Ingress**: Confirmed ingress resource was deleted during upgrade
2. **Verified Service Names**: Found correct service name `monitoring-grafana` vs backup's `grafana-service`
3. **Created Correct Ingress**: Applied ingress with proper service reference and TLS configuration
4. **Verified Functionality**: Confirmed Grafana accessible at `https://grafana.chat.canepro.me`

**Technical Details:**
```yaml
# Incorrect backup ingress (old):
service:
  name: grafana-service  # ❌ Wrong service name

# Correct ingress (fixed):
service:
  name: monitoring-grafana  # ✅ Correct service name
```

**Key Learnings:**
- **Service Naming Conventions**: Document actual service names created by Helm charts
- **Ingress Backup Strategy**: Always backup ingress before Helm operations
- **Upgrade Verification**: Test ingress accessibility after Helm upgrades
- **Helm Chart Behavior**: Understand how different charts manage ingress resources

**Impact:**
- ✅ Grafana restored within 10 minutes
- ✅ SSL certificate remained functional
- ✅ No data loss or service disruption beyond accessibility
- ✅ Comprehensive troubleshooting documentation added

**Prevention Measures Implemented:**
- Added ingress troubleshooting section to TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md
- Documented service naming conventions for kube-prometheus-stack
- Created backup ingress with correct service references
- Established pre-upgrade ingress verification checklist

## 🎯 **Phase 3: Repository Organization & Cleanup (September 6, 2025)**

### **3.1 Repository Structure Reorganization**

**What We Did:**
- Complete repository restructuring from 25+ scattered files to 10 organized directories
- Created logical separation with `config/`, `deployment/`, `docs/`, `monitoring/`, `scripts/`
- Moved all configuration files to appropriate subdirectories
- Removed 9+ unnecessary files (temporary scripts, backups, duplicates)
- Updated deployment scripts with new file paths
- Created comprehensive documentation for new structure

**Why We Did It:**
- Repository had become difficult to navigate with files scattered in root directory
- Mixed configuration files, scripts, and documentation without clear organization
- Needed professional structure for better maintenance and onboarding
- Preparation for future development and team collaboration

**Key Reorganization Changes:**
```text
Before: 25+ files in root directory

│   └── helm-values/values-*.yaml
├── deployment/deploy-aks-official.sh
├── docs/[comprehensive documentation]
├── monitoring/[all monitoring configs]
└── scripts/[utility scripts]
```

**Files Removed During Cleanup:**
- `apply-observability-fixes.sh` - Temporary fix script no longer needed

3. **Path Management**: Update all references when moving configuration files
4. **Documentation Importance**: Comprehensive documentation essential during reorganization
5. **Team Onboarding**: Organized structure significantly improves new team member experience

**Technical Implementation:**
```bash
# Key paths updated in deployment script:
# OLD: ./values-official.yaml
# NEW: ./config/helm-values/values-official.yaml

# OLD: ./clusterissuer.yaml  
# NEW: ./config/certificates/clusterissuer.yaml
