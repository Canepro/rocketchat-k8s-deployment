## 🔄 Lifecycle Automation Workflow

### 1. Pre-Teardown Backup Process

**Trigger**: Scheduled (e.g., day 12 of billing cycle) or manual

**Steps**:
1. **MongoDB Backup**: `mongodb-backup.sh`
   - Performs `mongodump` with authentication
   - Compresses and encrypts backup
   - Uploads to Azure Blob Storage
   - Stores encryption key in Azure Key Vault

2. **PVC Snapshots**: `create-pvc-snapshots.sh`
   - Creates Azure Disk Snapshots for all PVCs
   - Tags snapshots with timestamp and cluster state
   - Implements retention policy (7 days)

3. **Cluster State Backup**: `backup-cluster-state.sh`
   - Exports Helm values and chart versions
   - Backs up Kubernetes secrets (encrypted)
   - Saves ConfigMaps and ingress definitions
   - Preserves certificate states

4. **Validation**: `backup-validation.sh`
   - Verifies backup integrity
   - Checks snapshot creation
   - Validates cluster state export

### 2. Cluster Teardown Process

**Trigger**: After successful backup validation

**Steps**:
1. **Pre-flight Validation**: `teardown-cluster.sh`
   - Verifies backups exist and are valid
   - Confirms snapshots are created
   - Checks cluster state export

2. **Graceful Drain**: 
   - Drains nodes gracefully
   - Ensures no data loss during teardown

3. **Resource Cleanup**:
   - Deletes Helm releases
   - Removes Kubernetes resources
   - Destroys AKS cluster via Terraform

4. **Preservation**:
   - Preserves static IPs
   - Maintains DNS zones
   - Keeps storage snapshots

### 3. Cluster Recreation Process

**Trigger**: Manual or scheduled (e.g., day 2 of new billing cycle)

**Steps**:
1. **Infrastructure Creation**: `recreate-cluster.sh`
   - Terraform apply to create fresh AKS cluster
   - Installs base infrastructure (ingress, cert-manager)

2. **Data Restoration**:
   - Restores PVCs from Azure Disk Snapshots
   - Deploys MongoDB with restored data
   - Syncs secrets from Azure Key Vault

3. **Application Deployment**:
   - Deploys Rocket.Chat
   - Conditionally deploys monitoring stack
   - Configures DNS and SSL certificates

4. **Health Validation**:
   - Runs health checks and smoke tests
   - Validates all services are operational
