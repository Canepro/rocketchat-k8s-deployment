## üöÄ **Migration Execution**

### **Step 1: Final AKS Testing (15 minutes)**

**Test Rocket.Chat:**
```bash
# Test direct IP access
curl -I http://4.250.169.133

# Should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

**Test Grafana:**
```bash
# Port forward for testing
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring

# Access in browser: http://localhost:3000
# Login: admin / GrafanaAdmin2024!
```

**Test SSL:**
```bash
# Check certificate status
kubectl get certificaterequests -n rocketchat
kubectl get certificates -n rocketchat

# Should show: READY=True
```

### **Step 2: DNS Update (2 minutes)**

**Update BOTH domains simultaneously:**

1. **Log into DNS Provider**
2. **Update chat.canepro.me:**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: chat
   Value: 4.250.169.133
   TTL: 300 (5 minutes)
   ```
3. **Update grafana.chat.canepro.me:**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: grafana.chat
   Value: 4.250.169.133
   TTL: 300 (5 minutes)
   ```
4. **Save Changes**

### **Step 3: DNS Propagation Verification (10 minutes)**

**Monitor DNS propagation:**
```bash
# Check multiple DNS servers
nslookup chat.canepro.me 8.8.8.8
nslookup chat.canepro.me 1.1.1.1
nslookup grafana.chat.canepro.me 8.8.8.8

# Should return: 4.250.169.133
```

**Test production access:**
```bash
# Test HTTPS access
curl -I https://chat.canepro.me
curl -I https://grafana.chat.canepro.me

# Should return: HTTP/2 200
```

### **Step 4: Production Verification (20 minutes)**

**Monitor application logs:**
```bash
# Watch ingress logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx

# Watch Rocket.Chat logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/rocketchat -n rocketchat
```

**Test user functionality:**
- [ ] Login to Rocket.Chat
- [ ] Send test messages
- [ ] Access channels/teams
- [ ] File uploads working
- [ ] Search functionality

**Test monitoring:**
- [ ] Access Grafana at `https://grafana.chat.canepro.me`
- [ ] View Rocket.Chat dashboards
- [ ] Check Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Verify alerting setup

## üö® **Emergency Rollback Plan**

### **If Issues Occur Within 3-5 Days:**

**Immediate Action (2 minutes):**
1. **Update DNS back to MicroK8s:**
   ```
   chat.canepro.me ‚Üí 20.68.53.249
   grafana.chat.canepro.me ‚Üí 20.68.53.249
   ```

2. **Verify rollback:**
   ```bash
   nslookup chat.canepro.me
   # Should return: 20.68.53.249

   curl -I https://chat.canepro.me
   # Should return: HTTP/2 200
   ```

**Investigation (30 minutes):**
1. **Check AKS logs:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n rocketchat
   kubectl get pods -n monitoring
   kubectl logs -f deployment/rocketchat -n rocketchat
   ```

2. **Common issues:**
   - SSL certificate problems
   - MongoDB connection issues
   - Ingress configuration errors
   - Resource constraints

**Resolution Options:**
- Fix issues and retry DNS migration
- Keep MicroK8s as production for now
- Schedule another migration attempt
